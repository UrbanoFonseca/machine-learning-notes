## Total Causal Effect

Given a SCM, there is a total causal effect from X to Y if one of the following equivalent statements is satisfied:

* $$X \not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp Y$$in $$P_{do\ X}:=Ñ_X$$for some random variable $$Ñ_X$$. _i.e. randomize X and see that X and Y depend on each other_
* There are $$x^{\triangle}$$and $$x^{\square}$$, such that $$P^Y_{do\ X:=x^{\triangle}} \neq P^Y_{do\ X:=x^{\square}} $$
* There is $$x^{\triangle}$$, such that$$P^Y_{do\ X:=x^{\triangle}} \neq P^Y$$
* $$X \not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp Y$$ in $$P^{X,Y}_{do\ X:=Ñ_X} \neq P^Y$$for any $$Ñ_X$$whose distribution has full support
