## NAS vs SAN

**NAS** is short for Network Attached Storage. It is a file-level computer data storage server connected to a computer network that provides data access to a heterogenous group of clients.

**SAN** is short for Storage Area Network. Is is a computer network which provides access to a consolidated, block-level data storage. Is used primarily to acccess storage devices \(e.g. disk arrays, type libraries\) from servers so that the devices appear to the OS as direct-attached storage.

> While **NAS** is a single storage device that serves file over the Ethernet, **SAN** is a tightly coupled network of multiple devices that work with block-based data.
