# Final

## Definition

The `final` modifier can be applied to 4 constructs:

1. Variables - a final variable can be set only once
2. Fields - a final field can be set only once, by the constructor of the class that defines it
3. Methods - a final method cannot be overridden nor hidden
4. Classes - a final class cannot be extended

There are 3 motivations for using `final`: correctness, robustness and performance. Using `final` is a negative act as it limits default language mechanisms.
