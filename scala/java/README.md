# Java

## JDK, JRE & JVM

The **Java Development Kit** \(JDK\) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader \(Java\), a compiler \(javac\), an archiver \(jar\), a document generator \(javadoc\) and other tools for Java development.

The **Java Runtime Environment** \(JRE\) provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application, it consists of a JVM, core classes and supporting files.

The **Java Virtual Machine** \(JVM\) is responsible for executing the Java program line by line. 

JDK = JRE + Development Tools

JRE = JVM + Library Classes

## JAR

A JAR file is a Java Archive file used by the Java Runtime Environment \(JRE\), a framework for executing Java programs. JAR files are compressed with .zip compression.
